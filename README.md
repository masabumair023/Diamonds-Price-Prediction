# Diamonds-Price-Prediction
This project is a part of Udacity Nanodegree program (Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodgeree). In the Nanodegree, I have implemented this project in Alteryx and here I am implementing in Python.</br>
I have used Linear Regression model to predict the diamonds' prices.</br>
## Project Overview
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, I have developed a Linear Regression model in python to use the results from the predictions to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.
